# Mandlbrot-Set
Coded in Java

This uses a complex number class, which is able to do operations on, and create, complex numbers. This class is then used to create creates an image that visualizes the Mandelbrot set through the use of another class named MappingPanel that extends JPanel. The MappingPanel class overrides the paintComponent method of the JPanel class, which is called whenever the panel needs to be drawn. Inside this method, it creates a new Graphics2D object and sets up a scaling transformation that makes the image fit the window how we would like it to.
